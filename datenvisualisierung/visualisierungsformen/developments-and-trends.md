## Ordered Scatter Plots

When we visualize trends, we need at least one of the two variables to have a natural order. The typical example is a date or time variable. The analysis of a dependent variable over time is called time-series analysis.

The simplest way to display a development over time is to use a scatter plot. Instead of arbitrary two variables, we order the x-axis by the values of the first variable (e.g. date, time), and plot along the corresponding y-values.

## Line Charts

> "Line graphs are not limited to time series, however. They are appropriate whenever one variable imposes an ordering on the data." \[1]

### Multiple Series

## Pitfalls

### Cut or not to cut the y-axis?
