# 3 Libraries

## The `tidyverse`

Our most important library for R is the `tidyverse`. Make sure you install it in any project before you start working with data.

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

The `tidyverse` is a so-called meta-package. This means it combines many useful packages into one large package. The official website contains documentation on all the contained packages. I recommend you check it out to get a better picture:
