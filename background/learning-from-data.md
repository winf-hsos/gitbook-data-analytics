# Learning From Data

Many fields in science work by learning new things from data. Depending on the source of the data, we can expect to learn more or less from it. But about what do want to learn something from the data?

In technical terms, we can refer to the subject under examination as the **data generating process** **(DGP)**. No matter the field of science, there is some process that was observed, and the recorded observations are our data. Let's consider some examples of such data generating processes:

* Customers browsing and buying clothes in an online shop
* Random people answering a survey in front of a supermarket
* Patients in a hospital getting a particular cancer treatment
* Rats in a lab being given more or less food
* Diversity of species across the globe over time
* Behavior of a wind turbine in a wind canal

We could add many more items to that list, but I believe the examples above are sufficient to illustrate what we mean by a data generating process. In science, we don't just want to observe things for the fun of it, but we are rather interested in specific outcomes, which are the reason we collect and analyze the data in the first place.

* Which product display incentivizes most customers to buy?
* How big is the potential market for a vegan ice cream?
* Does the new drug cure cancer?
* Do rats who eat less live longer than those who eat as much as they want?
* How did the different species and their populations change over time?
* Which design of a wind turbine captures the most energy from wind?&#x20;
